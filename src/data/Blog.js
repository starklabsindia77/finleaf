However, it also had its own challenges in the journey down the years. In this article, we will Discuss CBIC Launches Drive To Clear All Pending GST Refund Claims.</p>",
    Description:
      "<h3>What does The GST Law say?</h3><p>According to the GST law, individuals and businesses can go for GST Return Filing for the input refunds falling under different slabs of tax refund criteria.</p><p>Also, the GST department has to clear all pending GST refund claims within 2 months without any liability to pay interest. So, they are now working on a priority to clear all pending claims.</p><h3>Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) Move</h3><p>To expedite the process of refund, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) has recently launched a tax refund drive to offer some respite to the businesses which are severely reeling under the Covid-19 weather since past more than a year now.</p><p>The CBIC will run a special refund disposal campaign From May 15th to 31st, 2021 in India. The drive aims to help the business circumvent its liquidity issues after lockdowns and a curfew in many states is leading to severe losses for many businesses in the country.</p><p>However, the CBIC’s instruction, in its official notification, noted that officers should strive to settle claims as soon as possible to meet the statutory deadlines.</p><p>The CBIC has instructed its senior field officials to oversee and monitor the refund process performance on a daily basis to avoid any lag or delay in the settlement. While also urging its workers to work closely with industry bodies working in the interest of exporters and small businesses.</p><h3>Expectation out of the Move</h3><p>Undoubtedly, the special drive, if followed in letter and spirit, would provide great relief to the businesses who have GST Registration numbers. Especially the small and medium enterprises, which are struggling in the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown situation. The move has the potential to bring liquidity in the market and hence can help to bring the businesses a sign of relief. And can boost the economy after the lockdown and COVID situation eases out.</p>",

    Description:

Withal, as rightly pointed out the by health experts around the globe, the cure-all for India, in so far as COVID 19 is concerned, lies in vaccination of the entire population.</p><p>As has been the direction and rightly so, policies are centred around the vulnerable population of the country while simultaneously assuring that the vaccine should reach entire population soon and in affordable manner. To ensure distribution at effective pricing, Indian government has petitioned to World Trade Organisation (WTO) that patents on vaccinations and other Covid similar items should be waived.</p><p>Within the country, a debate has started to exempt the vaccines from GST with petition coming from Chief Ministers, political parties to various NGO’s/ social agencies. While State Governments are favouring for NIL rate of GST i.e. detailed exemption to vaccines, FM in its reply explained the perils of exemptions in terms of reduced input tax credits (‘ITC’) to manufacturer indirectly leading to increased costs of vaccines to absolute consumers.</p><h3>Further Notification by Central Government</h3><p>Additionally, it is a common knowledge that the burden of indirect taxes is borne by the ultimate consumer and indirect taxes has inclination to improve inflation by increasing prices at end consumers in line with boost in rate of indirect taxes. Intermediate manufacturing or supply chain passes tax burden on value-add basis as it avails ITC of GST paid by its suppliers.</p><p>Once the supplied are established as deemed exports, GST framework (with elaborative procedures) furnishes further benefits to supplier and / or recipient of such supplies in form of GST Refunds. Thus, deemed exports concept ensures goods manufactured in India and supplied to specified individuals would result in zero / lesser tax burden.</p>",
